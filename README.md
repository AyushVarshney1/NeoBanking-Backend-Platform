# NeoBanking Backend Platform - Scalable Microservices Architecture
#### Event-Driven Digital Banking Backend with Spring Boot, gRPC, Kafka, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Docker


# Introduction

NeoBanking Backend Platform is a production-like digital banking system built on a scalable microservices architecture. It demonstrates how modern banks handle authentication, account management, transactions, notifications, and audits in a secure, event-driven, and distributed environment.

The project integrates Spring Boot, gRPC, Kafka, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Docker to simulate real-world transaction workflows, inter-service communication, and asynchronous event processing â€” laying the foundation for resilient, high-performance financial platforms.

The following diagram illustrates the overall architecture of the NeoBank backend, showcasing how different services interact synchronously (gRPC/REST) and asynchronously (Kafka events).
